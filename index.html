<h2> About </h2>

<p> My name is Alex Lopez. I am a third year at Drexel University majoring in Computing and Security Technologies. I have always had an interest in technology dating back to the summer of seventh grade where I built a laptop using a Raspberry Pi at a computer camp. I kept that passion for technology going into high school, where in my sophomore year I assembled a PC from scratch. </p> 

<p>I first became interested in cyber security when I read the book <u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital/dp/0770436196"> <i>Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon</i> </u> </a> by Kim Zetter. I love that cybersecurity is an evolving field; there is always more to learn.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>These are projects that I took on to further my understanding of cybersecurity concepts and to get better at coding with Python.
    <li><u><a href="https://github.com/al3637/outlook">Outlook Automater</a></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>While at my previous co-op I created files to automate certain processes for outlook. I learned how to interact with the Outlook application, and also maintained my python skills.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Laptop Running Arch Linux</li>
    <ul>
        <li>To deepen my understanding of Linux. command line navigation, and scripting, I repurposed a laptop and installed Arch Linux on it from scratch. This hands-on approach has allowed me to dive into scripting projects, enhancing my proficiency with Linux.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><u><a href="https://github.com/al3637/Key-Logger">Key Logger</a></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a basic key logger that I am working on. The keylogger tracks the keys pressed and stores them in a new file called 'clean.txt'.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><u><a href="https://github.com/al3637/password">Password Checker</a></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a simple password checker that detects if your password has at least 8 characters, a number, and a special character in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><u><a href="https://github.com/al3637/Encryption">Ceaser Cipher</a></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a ceaser cipher I created while following along a <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYng_rXg5OQ">YouTube video.</a></u></li>
    </ul>
    <li><u><a href="https://github.com/al3637/RPS">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
