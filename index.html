</div>

<h2> About </h2>

<p> My name is Alex Lopez, I am a second year at Drexel University majoring in Computing and Security Technologies. I have always had an interest in technology dating back to the summer of seventh grade where I built a laptop using a Raspberry Pi at a computer camp. I kept that passion for technology going into highschool where in my sophomore year I build a pc from scratch. </p> 

<p>I first became interested in cyber security when I read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital/dp/0770436196"> <i>Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon</i> </a> by Kim Zetter. I became enthralled in cybersecurity and have remained so until this day. I love that cybersecurity is an always evolving field, there is always more to learn.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>These are projects that I took on to further my understanding of cybersecurity concepts and to get better at coding with Python. Clicking on the project titles will bring you to their GitHub repositories.</p>
